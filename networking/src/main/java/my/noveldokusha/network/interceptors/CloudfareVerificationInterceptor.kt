/**
 * If a CloudFare security verification redirection is detected, execute a
 * WebView, wait for the challenge to resolve, harvest the cf_clearance cookie
 * (plus any other cookies Cloudflare set), then retry the original request.
 *
 * Improvements over the original implementation (and additional techniques
 * ported from the **trawl** Cloudflare-bypass engine):
 *
 *  1. **Tier 1 — body scan detection** — not just 403/503 + Server header.
 *     Cloudflare sometimes returns 200 with a challenge HTML body and no
 *     `Server` header, which the old code missed entirely.
 *  2. **Tier 1 — `cf-mitigated` header** — Cloudflare sets this header on
 *     challenged/blocked responses even when the body is empty or
 *     non-HTML. Checking it catches a class of API-level blocks that the
 *     body scan misses.
 *  3. **Tier 1 — HTTP 202 bot-gate** — some CDNs (and CF itself, in some
 *     configs) return 202 with a challenge body instead of 403/503.
 *  4. **Tier 1 — DDoS-Guard detection** — DDoS-Guard is a CF competitor
 *     used by several novel sites; its challenge page is similar enough
 *     that the same WebView bypass works, but the detection markers differ.
 *  5. **Polling-based completion** — instead of a fixed 20 s sleep, we poll
 *     the WebView's CookieManager every 300 ms and exit as soon as
 *     `cf_clearance` appears OR the page URL changes away from the
 *     challenge URL. Fast challenges finish in ~2 s instead of always
 *     waiting 20 s.
 *  6. **Retry mechanism** — up to [MAX_BYPASS_ATTEMPTS] attempts. A single
 *     transient Cloudflare hiccup no longer kills the entire fetch.
 *  7. **Full header forwarding** — Referer, Accept, Accept-Language, and the
 *     modern `Sec-CH-UA-*` client hints are forwarded to the WebView so its
 *     fingerprint matches the OkHttp request that triggered the challenge.
 *  8. **UA consistency** — the WebView's userAgentString is forced to match
 *     [UserAgentInterceptor.DEFAULT_USER_AGENT] so Cloudflare sees the same
 *     browser on the initial fetch and on the challenge fetch. This is the
 *     #1 cause of "challenge loops" — CF remembers the UA that triggered
 *     it.
 *  9. **Title-based completion detection** (from trawl) — in addition to
 *     checking for the `cf_clearance` cookie, we also check the WebView's
 *     page title. When the title no longer matches `just a moment` /
 *     `verify you are human` / etc., the challenge is done. This catches
 *     challenges that set the cookie late or via a redirect that doesn't
 *     change the URL.
 * 10. **Force re-navigation when stuck** (from trawl) — if `cf_clearance`
 *     has been set but the page is still on the challenge URL after 5 s,
 *     we manually load the original URL. CF sometimes "forgets" to fire
 *     the auto-redirect; doing it ourselves breaks the loop.
 * 11. **Turnstile checkbox click** (from trawl) — we inject JS to dispatch
 *     a click event at the Turnstile iframe. For interactive Turnstile
 *     widgets, this is what actually solves the challenge. For non-
 *     interactive ("managed") widgets, it's a harmless no-op.
 * 12. **IP-block fast-fail** (from trawl) — if the WebView navigates to a
 *     URL containing `/cdn-cgi/error/` or `error=1020`/`error=1015`, we
 *     abort immediately. No amount of cookie-baking will fix a hard IP
 *     block; the user needs a different network.
 * 13. **Leak-safe WebView lifecycle** — WebView is created on the main
 *     thread, always stopLoading() + destroy() in a finally block, AND we
 *     reset the WebViewClient reference before destroy() to avoid holding
 *     the activity context via the WebViewClient's outer class reference.
 * 14. **Cookie preservation** — we keep ALL existing cookies (not just
 *     strip cf_clearance) and let the WebView add new ones on top. This
 *     preserves session/language cookies that some CF-fronted sites rely
 *     on.
 * 15. **Body-less 403 handling** — we close the original response body
 *     before retrying so we never leak a connection.
