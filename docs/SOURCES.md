## Architecture Notes

### Source Interface

All sources implement `SourceInterface` (defined in `SourceInterface.kt`). There are two subtypes:

- **`SourceInterface.Base`** — Sources with only a base URL (no catalog/search). Used for sources like Reddit, Sousetsuka, AT.
- **`SourceInterface.Catalog`** — Sources with a catalog URL, search, book info, chapter list, and chapter reader. Most sources implement this.

### Registration

Sources are registered in `Scraper.kt` via the `sourcesList` set. Each source
takes a `NetworkClient` parameter for HTTP requests. The `Scraper` class is
provided via Hilt dependency injection.

### String Resources

Each source has a display name string in
`strings/src/main/res/values/strings-no-translatable.xml` with the naming
convention `source_name_<id>`.

### Testing

Each catalog source has an instrumented test in
`app/src/androidTest/java/my/noveldokusha/SourcesCatalogTest.kt` that verifies
the source can be opened in the app.

Unit tests in `app/src/test/java/my/noveldokusha/ScraperTest.kt` verify that:
- All source base URLs end with a slash
- All source IDs are unique
- All sources can be found by their base URL

### ProGuard / R8 Rules

The app's ProGuard rules (`app/proguard-rules.pro`) include `-keep` rules for:
- All source classes under `my.noveldokusha.scraper.sources.**`
- All database classes under `my.noveldokusha.scraper.databases.**`
- The `Scraper` registry class
- The `SourceInterface` sealed interface and its nested subtypes
- All networking interceptors (including the Cloudflare bypass)
- Custom exception classes

This ensures that R8's code removal doesn't strip source metadata (IDs, base
URLs, string resource IDs) that are accessed reflectively at runtime.

### Database Migrations

When a source's domain changes, a database migration is added in
`tooling/local_database/src/main/java/my/noveldokusha/feature/local_database/migrations/`
to update stored URLs. Historical migrations for removed sources are kept to
support users with older databases.

## Cloudflare Bypass

Many novel hosting sites are protected by Cloudflare's "managed challenge" or
"JS challenge" systems. NovelDokusha includes a **multi-tier** Cloudflare
evasion/bypass mechanism inspired by the [trawl](https://github.com/germondai/trawl)
project. The bypass lives in two files:

- `networking/src/main/java/my/noveldokusha/network/interceptors/BrowserHeadersInterceptor.kt`
  — Tier 1: makes every OkHttp request look like a real Chrome navigation so
  most sites never escalate to a challenge in the first place.
- `networking/src/main/java/my/noveldokusha/network/interceptors/CloudfareVerificationInterceptor.kt`
  — Tier 2/3: if a challenge is still served, fires up a headless WebView to
  solve it, harvests the `cf_clearance` cookie, and retries the original
  request.

### Tier 1 — Browser-headers evasion

The `BrowserHeadersInterceptor` sets the standard set of headers that Chrome
sends on every navigation request. Many bot-protection services never escalate
to a JS challenge at all if the initial request looks browser-like; conversely,
a request that omits these headers is trivially identifiable as a non-browser
client. The headers set (each only if not already present on the request):

| Header | Value | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| `Accept` | `text/html,application/xhtml+xml,...` | Standard browser content negotiation |
| `Accept-Language` | `en-US,en;q=0.9` | Matches the WebView default |
| `Accept-Encoding` | `gzip, deflate, br` | DecodeResponseInterceptor handles decompression |
| `Cache-Control` | `no-cache` | Avoids serving stale CF challenge pages from cache |
| `Pragma` | `no-cache` | HTTP/1.0 equivalent, belt-and-suspenders |
| `Upgrade-Insecure-Requests` | `1` | Chrome always sends this on navigations |
| `Sec-Fetch-Dest` | `document` | Modern browser fingerprint signal |
| `Sec-Fetch-Mode` | `navigate` | Modern browser fingerprint signal |
| `Sec-Fetch-Site` | `none` | Top-level navigation, no referrer |
| `Sec-Fetch-User` | `?1` | User-initiated navigation |
| `Sec-CH-UA` | `"Chromium";v="120",...` | Matches the User-Agent set by UserAgentInterceptor |
| `Sec-CH-UA-Mobile` | `?1` | Mobile UA |
| `Sec-CH-UA-Platform` | `"Android"` | Matches the Pixel UA |

### Tier 2/3 — WebView-based challenge solving

When a response is detected as a Cloudflare challenge, the
`CloudFareVerificationInterceptor` takes over:

1. **Detection** — The interceptor checks every response for Cloudflare
   signatures:
   - HTTP 202/403/429/502/503 with a `Server: cloudflare*` (or `ddos-guard*`)
     header, OR
   - The `cf-mitigated` response header is present (CF sets this even on
     non-HTML responses — strongest signal), OR
   - Response body containing Cloudflare challenge markers (e.g.
     `cf-browser-verification`, `Just a moment`, `challenge-platform`,
     `cf-turnstile`, `verify you are human`, `id="turnstile-wrapper"`,
     `ddos-guard.net`, etc.) — this catches "managed challenge" pages that
     return HTTP 200 with no Server header.

2. **WebView-based bypass** — When a challenge is detected:
   - A headless `WebView` is created on the main thread (required by Android).
   - The WebView's User-Agent is forced to match the OkHttp request's
     User-Agent (critical — Cloudflare rejects challenges where the UA
     differs between the triggering request and the challenge-solving
     request).
   - All relevant headers (Accept, Accept-Language, Referer, Sec-CH-UA-*,
     Sec-Fetch-*) are forwarded to the WebView so the fingerprint matches.
   - The WebView loads the challenged URL, which triggers Cloudflare's
     JavaScript challenge.

3. **Multi-signal completion detection** — The interceptor polls every 300ms
   and exits as soon as ANY of:
   - The `cf_clearance` cookie appears in the `CookieManager`, OR
   - The page title changes away from a challenge title (`Just a moment`,
     `Verify you are human`, `Please wait`, `One more step`,
     `Attention required`, `Checking your browser`) — catches challenges
     that set the cookie via a redirect that doesn't change the URL, OR
   - The page URL navigates away from the challenge URL.

4. **Force re-navigation when stuck** — If `cf_clearance` has been set but
   the page is still on the challenge URL after 5 seconds, the interceptor
   manually loads the original URL. This is the trick trawl uses to break
   "cookie set but page stuck" loops that Turnstile sometimes triggers.

5. **Turnstile checkbox click** — Every 3 seconds, the interceptor injects
   JavaScript into the WebView that dispatches a click event at the
   Cloudflare Turnstile iframe (and a fallback in-page widget). For
   interactive Turnstile widgets, this is what actually solves the
   challenge; for non-interactive ("managed") widgets, it's a harmless
   no-op.

6. **IP-block fast-fail** — If the WebView navigates to a URL containing
   `/cdn-cgi/error/`, `error=1020`, or `error=1015`, the interceptor
   aborts immediately with a clear error message. No amount of
   cookie-baking will fix a hard IP block; the user needs a different
   network.

7. **Cookie sharing** — The `ScraperCookieJar` (OkHttp's CookieJar) is
   backed by the same `android.webkit.CookieManager` as the WebView. So
   when the WebView solves the challenge and receives `cf_clearance`,
   OkHttp automatically picks it up for subsequent requests.

8. **Retry mechanism** — If the first bypass attempt fails (still
   challenged after retry), the interceptor retries up to 3 times. Each
   attempt creates a fresh WebView.

9. **Leak safety** — The WebView is always `stopLoading()` + `destroy()`
   in a `finally` block, and the `WebViewClient` reference is reset
   before destroy to avoid leaking the Activity context.

### Configuration

The bypass behavior is controlled by these constants in the interceptor file:

| Constant | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `MAX_BYPASS_ATTEMPTS` | 3 | Max WebView retries per challenged request |
| `MAX_CHALLENGE_WAIT` | 20 seconds | Hard cap on single attempt duration |
| `CHALLENGE_POLL_INTERVAL` | 300ms | Cookie polling frequency |
| `FORCE_NAVIGATION_DELAY` | 5 seconds | Grace period before force-re-navigating a stuck challenge |
| `ERROR_CODES` | 202, 403, 429, 502, 503 | HTTP status codes that trigger challenge detection |
| `CHALLENGE_HEADER_NAMES` | `cf-mitigated` | Response headers whose presence indicates a challenge |
| `SERVER_HEADER_VALUES` | cloudflare, ddos-guard, ... | `Server` header values that identify CF/DDoS-Guard |
| `CHALLENGE_BODY_MARKERS` | 21 markers | Body substrings that identify a challenge page |
| `CHALLENGE_TITLE_MARKERS` | 6 markers | Page-title substrings that indicate an active challenge |
| `IP_BLOCKED_URL_MARKERS` | `/cdn-cgi/error/`, `error=1020`, `error=1015` | URL patterns indicating a hard IP block |

### Interceptor chain order

The OkHttp interceptors are applied in this order (defined in
`NetworkClient.kt`):

1. `HttpLoggingInterceptor` (debug builds only) — logs full request/response
   bodies.
2. `UserAgentInterceptor` — sets a modern Android Chrome User-Agent if none
   is present.
3. `BrowserHeadersInterceptor` — Tier 1: adds the browser-fingerprint
   headers described above.
4. `DecodeResponseInterceptor` — decompresses `gzip` and `br` response
   bodies.
5. `CloudFareVerificationInterceptor` — Tier 2/3: detects challenges and
   solves them via WebView.

Order matters: the User-Agent must be set before the browser headers so
that `Sec-CH-UA` can match it; the decode interceptor must run before the
Cloudflare interceptor so that compressed challenge bodies can be inspected.

### Limitations

- **Turnstile interactive challenges** — The interceptor injects JavaScript
  to click the Turnstile checkbox, which works for most interactive widgets.
  However, Cloudflare may occasionally serve a harder challenge (e.g.
  image-based) that cannot be solved headlessly. In that case the bypass
  will time out after 20 seconds and retry.
- **IP-level blocks** — If Cloudflare blocks the IP entirely (error 1020 /
  1015), the interceptor detects this and fails fast with a clear error
  message. The user would need to use a different network.
- **Android WebView required** — The bypass uses `android.webkit.WebView`,
  which is only available on Android devices. It does not work in unit
  tests or on JVM.
- **First-request cost** — The first challenged request on a fresh session
  pays the full WebView solve cost (2-20 seconds). Subsequent requests to
  the same domain reuse the cached `cf_clearance` cookie and pay no cost.

## TimoTxt Translation Pipeline

The three TimoTxt sources (`TimoTxt`, `TimoTxtTranslate`, `TimoTxtGemini`)
all read from `www.timotxt.com`, a Chinese novel site behind Cloudflare.
They differ in how they fetch content and whether they translate it.

### The Cloudflare bypass trick

`www.timotxt.com` is behind Cloudflare, which can challenge non-browser
HTTP clients. Direct OkHttp fetches may get a 403/503 challenge page.

The `BrowserHeadersInterceptor` (Tier 1) makes every OkHttp request look
like a real Chrome navigation, which is enough for timotxt.com's
Cloudflare configuration — the site serves full content (HTTP 200) to
requests that carry the standard `Sec-Fetch-*`, `Sec-CH-UA-*`, and
`Accept-*` headers. The `CloudFareVerificationInterceptor` (Tier 2/3)
is still in the chain as a fallback for when Cloudflare escalates to a
JS challenge; on timotxt.com this rarely triggers in practice.

**Important**: The `translate.goog` domain mentioned in older versions
of this document is **not** used for HTTP fetching. It exists only as a
**routing key** — a fake `baseUrl` that lets the app's
`getCompatibleSource()` distinguish books belonging to the
`TimoTxtTranslate` source from the plain `TimoTxt` source. All actual
HTTP traffic goes to `https://www.timotxt.com/`. The
`transformChapterUrl()` method converts the stored `translate.goog` URL
back to `timotxt.com` before each fetch; without this conversion the
reader would try to fetch from `translate.goog` (which returns HTTP 400
without Google Translate query params) and the chapter body would never
load.

### The `toTranslateUrl()` helper

**Removed** — the previous `toTranslateUrl()` helper that wrapped URLs
in the `translate.goog` proxy format is no longer used. Both
`TimoTxtTranslate` and `TimoTxtGemini` fetch directly from
`https://www.timotxt.com/` and translate the extracted text separately.
The `translate.goog` and `gemini.goog` strings appear only in the
stored `baseUrl` for routing purposes (see "The Cloudflare bypass
trick" above).

### Translation strategies

| Source | Translation backend | API endpoint | Quality | Speed |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|---------|-------|
| `TimoTxt` | None (raw Chinese) | — | — | Fastest |
| `TimoTxtTranslate` | Google Translate API (free `gtx` client) | `translate.googleapis.com/translate_a/single?client=gtx` | Good | Fast (batch) |
| `TimoTxtGemini` | Google Gemini AI | `generativelanguage.googleapis.com` (via `GeminiApiClient`) | Best | Slower (AI reasoning) |

### Chapter text translation pipeline

1. **Fetch HTML** directly from `https://www.timotxt.com/` (the
   `BrowserHeadersInterceptor` handles Cloudflare; the stored
   `translate.goog` / `gemini.goog` URL is converted back to
   `timotxt.com` by `transformChapterUrl()` / `resolveOriginalUrl()` /
   `fromGeminiUrl()` before each fetch).
2. **Extract paragraphs** using Jsoup. Strip `<script>`, `<style>`,
   `<iframe>`, `.gadBlock`, `.ads`, `.share-buttons`, `.pager` elements
   from the content div (`.chapter-content .content`).
3. **Clean** the extracted text: strip site notices
   (`溫馨提示.*`, `PS：.*`, etc.), remove non-whitelisted Unicode
   (Korean Hangul, rare CJK compat artifacts), collapse whitespace.
4. **Chunk** into batches of ~**4500 characters** (Google Translate's
   free `client=gtx` endpoint handles 5000+ chars per POST; 4500 is a
   safe ceiling that cuts batch count by >50% versus the old 2000-char
   limit).
5. **Batch translate**:
   - `TimoTxtTranslate`: Joins titles/paragraphs with `|||` separator,
     sends as a single Google Translate API request, splits the response
     back. Retries with exponential backoff on rate-limit (HTTP 429).
     Chapter text uses 3 retries; catalog titles and book descriptions
     use **fast-fail** (1 attempt, no retry delay) so a flaky API never
     blocks browsing — the original Chinese text is shown instead.
   - `TimoTxtGemini`: Sends each chunk to Gemini with a prompt that
     instructs it to translate Chinese → English while preserving
     paragraph structure and not adding commentary. Skips translation
     entirely if no Gemini API key is configured in Settings.
6. **Clean up** junk patterns: translate.goog injects "Translate" UI
   text and Google Translate occasionally produces artifacts like
   `[...]` or `>>>`. The `CHINESE_JUNK_PATTERNS` and
   `ENGLISH_JUNK_PATTERNS` regexes strip these.

### Catalog and search URL format

Catalog and search requests go directly to `https://www.timotxt.com/`:

```
https://www.timotxt.com/bookstack/?page=<N>
https://www.timotxt.com/search/<query>
```

The `/bookstack/` path (with trailing slash) is the catalog browse
endpoint. The `/search/<query>` path is Cloudflare-protected and may
trigger the WebView-based challenge solver on the first request; once
the `cf_clearance` cookie is cached, subsequent requests are fast.

The `TimoTxtGemini` source uses a different `baseUrl`
(`https://www-timotxt-com-gemini.goog/`) purely for **routing
uniqueness** — so the app's source selector can distinguish it from
`TimoTxtTranslate`. Internally, both fetch from `timotxt.com`. The
`transformChapterUrl()` and `fromGeminiUrl()` methods in
`TimoTxtGemini` convert the `gemini.goog` URL back to `timotxt.com`
before any HTTP fetch or WebView display.

### Limitations

- **Google Translate rate limits** — Under heavy use, the free
  `client=gtx` endpoint may return HTTP 429. The code retries with
  exponential backoff, but sustained bulk translation will fail.
  Catalog titles and book descriptions use fast-fail mode (1 attempt)
  so browsing always works even when the API is rate-limited.
- **Gemini API key required** — `TimoTxtGemini` requires the user to
  enter a Gemini API key in Settings. Without a key, all translation is
  skipped and the original Chinese text is shown for titles,
  descriptions, and chapter bodies.
- **timotxt.com HTML structure changes** — If the site changes its HTML
  output (e.g., adds new wrapper tags, changes the chapter content
  selector), the extraction code needs to be updated. The
  `div.chapter-content div.content` selector and the `.chaplist ul.all`
  chapter list selector are the most critical.
- **No image translation** — Text inside images (e.g., chapter
  illustrations with Chinese captions) is not translated.
